# Using-VGGT: Aligning Point Clouds and Improving Signle Image Inference

Within VGGT_Tutorial.ipynb (works in colab), you can learn to use VGGT to generate point clouds from any set of images, and align the point clouds to specified coordinate systems that can correspond to real-world geometry. 

Then, you can use generative AI models like Qwen-Image_edit-2509 and specialized Loras to generate images of a scene from different angles. Then try to use the generated images to improve VGGT inference on the original image.
