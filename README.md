# Using-VGGT: Aligning Point Clouds and Improving Signle Image Inference

Within VGGT_Tutorial.ipynb (works in colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xU7Tdr8WnSlEhEA97wclnj0CLlZR-fZl?usp=sharing), you can learn to use VGGT to generate point clouds from any set of images, and align the point clouds to specified coordinate systems that can correspond to real-world geometry. 

Then, you can use generative AI models like Qwen-Image_edit-2509 and specialized Loras to generate images of a scene from different angles. Then try to use the generated images to improve VGGT inference on the original image.
